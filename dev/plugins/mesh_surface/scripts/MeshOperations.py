"""
This class performs the meshing of the geo file generated in PreMeshingFunctions.py. It allows the use of NetCDF 
files as a mesh-size metric on a planar surface or the generation of a mesh with no NetCDF specified. Once the 
geo file has been appropriately appended to include the necessary field it meshes the file with the selected 
meshing algorithm in the background and opens the .msh in Gmsh.
